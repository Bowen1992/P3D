Plant 3D (P3D): A plant phenotyping toolkit for 3D point clouds

![Test](P3D_figure_V3.JPG)

<h2> What is P3D?</h2>
  
Plant 3D (P3D) automatically extracts common phenotyping features of interest from high-resolution 3D scans of plant architectures. 
P3D is open-source and is bundled with a stand-alone Windows application. P3D is written in C++ using OpenGL, QT, TensorFlow, and the point cloud library (PCL). 
P3D can visualize and process data imported as a 3D point cloud (<TT>pcd</TT> or <TT>txt</TT> formats) or a mesh (<TT>obj</TT> format). 

<h3>The tool focuses on four phenotyping tasks</h3> 
<OL>
  <li>Lamina vs stem classification</li>
  <li>Lamina counting and segmentation</li>
  <li>Stem skeletonization</li>
  <li>Whole leaf labeling</li>
</OL>
The algorithms developed for these tasks are novel and were recently shown to improve accuracy and/or run-time, compared to existing methods, on a large dataset of 3D plant architectures~\citep{Ziamtsov2019}.
